# Tv-shows-fb-pages-network-analysis

- This is a portfolio project that aims to analyze facebook pages of TV shows using network graphs where each TV show page is a node while mutual like between two pages is an edge.
- This project was a part of coursework for Advanced Topics in Data Mining module, taught under Master's in Data Science Program.
- It has a notebook where all the processes of the project, introduction, goals and results are thoroughly written and guides a reader quite well.
- Overview of the project:
    - A brief ficitional story how this project reflects real-world problem.
    - Exploratory data analysis like top 10 TV shows, degree distribution among all TV shows.
    - Analysis of important graph properties like density of the network, connectiveness, average shortest path length, clustering, assortativity.
    - Central nodes of the graph were also analyzed using degree centrality, betweenness centrality , closeness centrality and eigenvector centrality ranks.
    - Community discovering in the network was done using two algorithms and their performances were analyzed.
    - By investigating community members of central nodes, we try to analyze if top shows are belonging to similar/same clusters and we analyze their degree and centrality ranks to find patterns.
    - These patterns would help identify top TV shows based on different metrics that will help to disover similar TV shows and then use this information further.
